# mc-plus

## What is this?
This is a Minecraft 1.17 'Plus' modpack that is designed to enrich the features the vanilla version delivers. This has been specially created to be used on our server! A detailed list of the mods and their content can be found below.

## Server?
That's right! This is a formal invitation to join us on a way too ambitious server that has been designed to create a fun community for everyone to play on. This server will contain both English and Dutch speaking people, so keep mind of this.

To start your journey, please look at the installation guide below. Also read through the rules and guidelines of the server. Because we want to have a friendly and healthy community, we ask everyone to follow these. Results of violation of one of these rules can range from a simple warning to a temp ban or even a perma ban. Ofcourse we don't want to restrict any creativity or social interactions between our players, so if you don't agree with one of these or you thought of a rule that should be put in place, be sure to let us know. Either by sending me (Snil#4013) a DM on Discord or by adding an issue to this repo (if you know how this works ofcourse).

## Rules & Guidelines
- Griefing and stealing from other players is not allowed, this can result in a ban.
- Any kind of hate speech or genuine disrespect towards other players will not be tolerated.
- RDM (Random Deathmatch) is not allowed on the server. This doesn't mean PvP is not allowed.
- No hacking or exploiting (e.g. item duping), this can also result in a ban.
- Limit the use of automated farms (specifically mobfarms), they are allowed but be sure to ask an admin first (too many farms will cause tps issues / lag).
